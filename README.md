This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust involving unsafe code and raw pointers. Modifying a vector through a raw pointer after it has been borrowed leads to undefined behavior. The solution shows how to safely achieve the intended modification.  This example highlights the importance of understanding memory management and avoiding unsafe code unless absolutely necessary.
